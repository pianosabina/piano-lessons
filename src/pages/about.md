# About



Hey👋🏼,

Welcome to my website.

Here you can quickly book a piano lesson with me. 

Otherwise, my name is Sabina. I’m highly educated and skilled in the field of music. 

I've been playing both piano and drums for more than 20 years. Also, I’m a music composer and lately I started producing house music.

In addition, I'm educated in pedagogy and didactics.

Don’t hesitate to connect with me on different social platforms, and to [write to me](./contact) anytime you need help or have some questions regarding the piano.

PS You can write me both in English and Norwegian. 😊

Best,

Sabina
